('2026-02-27', 'Hegseth Threatens Defense Production Act to Force Anthropic to Remove AI Safety Guardrails',
 'Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave AI company Anthropic an ultimatum: allow unrestricted military use of its Claude AI system by Friday or face the Defense Production Act — a Korean War-era law that can compel private companies to produce for the military. Anthropic refused, citing concerns about autonomous weapons, domestic surveillance of Americans, and AI hallucinations causing lethal targeting errors. Under Secretary Emil Michael publicly called Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei "a liar" on social media. Trump then ordered all government agencies to "immediately cease" using Anthropic technology, calling it a "radical left, woke company." This marks the first time the DPA has been threatened to force a company to remove safety features from its product.',

 'Contact your senators on the Armed Services Committee. Ask: "Do you support using the Defense Production Act to force a private company to remove safety features from its AI — features that prevent lethal targeting errors?" Ask your House representative: "Should the government be able to compel a tech company to make its products less safe?" Support organizations defending corporate speech rights and AI safety standards. Share what''s happening — most Americans don''t know the DPA is being weaponized against safety guardrails.',
