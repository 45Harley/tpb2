# TPB's 1000-Fold Expansions (Plural)

Seven independent growth vectors, each capable of 1000x on its own. Together, multiplicative.

## Expansion 1: Education
One teacher → 30 students → 90 families → neighboring schools → district-wide
*The kids carry it home.*
- Priority outreach: Joe Courtney (Education Committee), Chris Murphy (HELP Committee)

## Expansion 2: Faith Communities
TPB is built on the Golden Rule — 5.9 billion people across 10 religions already agree. One pastor introduces TPB to a congregation of 200 → families → sister churches across the state
*The Golden Rule is the universal handshake.*

## Expansion 3: Local Government
One town clerk links TPB from the town website → every resident searching for services lands there → neighboring town clerks ask "what's that?"
*Government validates it. Citizens trust it.*

## Expansion 4: Nonprofits & Service Orgs
United Way. Food banks. Community Action agencies. They already serve Maria and Tom. One org adopts TPB as a resource guide → their entire client base arrives
*They don't need convincing — they need the tool.*

## Expansion 5: Libraries
Librarians are the original information navigators. One library system puts TPB on their resource page → every patron in the network
*The quietest, most trusted multiplier in America.*

## Expansion 6: Senior Centers
Tom, 67, fixed income. One senior center demo → word of mouth at the speed of grandparents
*Seniors vote. Seniors talk. Seniors have time.*

## Expansion 7: Veterans / Service Organizations
VFW, American Legion, Rotary. People who already understand civic duty. One post → the national network
*They served the country once. This lets them serve it again.*

## The Compounding Effect

They cross-pollinate:
- The student brings it to church
- The church member is a town clerk
- The town clerk tells the library
- The librarian's husband is at the VFW
- The VFW member's daughter is a teacher

Each expansion is 1000x on its own. Together, they're not additive — they're **multiplicative**.

Seven seeds. Seven forests. One platform.
