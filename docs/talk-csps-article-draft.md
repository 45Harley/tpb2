# The Rays Converge: Building Civic Infrastructure on Spiritual Ground

*A draft article for CSPS publishing*

---

There is a woman in Hartford named Maria. She is thirty-four, a single mother of two, working retail for $32,000 a year. Her electric bill runs $180 a month because the building has poor insulation. Childcare costs consume what's left. She qualifies for $9,600 a year in state and federal assistance — childcare subsidies, energy weatherization, health coverage for her kids — but she doesn't know it. The information exists, scattered across a dozen government websites written in language designed to protect agencies, not to help mothers.

There is a man in Bridgeport named Tom. He is sixty-seven, a retired teacher on a fixed income, watching property taxes rise on the house he paid off twenty years ago. He takes five prescriptions that cost $320 a month. His wife has Alzheimer's. He qualifies for $4,200 a year in property tax relief and pharmaceutical assistance. But the eligibility requirements are buried in legal jargon, and Tom — who spent forty years making complex subjects clear for teenagers — cannot make sense of it.

There is a young man in New Haven named Jamal. He is twenty-two, a recent college graduate, paying off student loans, sharing an apartment with roommates, dreaming of homeownership the way his generation has been told not to. He qualifies for up to $20,000 in down payment assistance through a state housing program. He has never heard of it.

Maria, Tom, and Jamal are not abstractions. They represent millions of Americans who have earned access to help and cannot find it — not because the programs don't exist, but because no one has gathered the scattered information into focus.

## The Lens

Mary Baker Eddy writes in *Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures*:

> "The rays of infinite Truth, when gathered into the focus of ideas, bring light instantaneously, whereas a thousand years of human doctrines, hypotheses, and vague conjectures emit no such effulgence." (504:23)

I have been thinking about this passage for a long time — not as theology, but as method. What does it look like to gather rays into the focus of ideas? Not in the abstract, but practically. Concretely. For Maria.

The rays are there. Connecticut's Care4Kids program is a ray — a real thing, a real amount, a real phone number. The EnergizeCT weatherization program is a ray. The HUSKY health insurance eligibility is a ray. The Senior Property Tax Relief program. The ConnPACE pharmaceutical assistance. The CHFA down payment program. Every one of these is a ray of something real, aimed at someone real.

But scattered rays don't illuminate. A thousand government websites, each with its own navigation, its own jargon, its own eligibility charts formatted for lawyers — "a thousand years of human doctrines, hypotheses, and vague conjectures." Time doesn't focus these rays. Process doesn't focus them. Committees don't focus them. Only *ideas* focus them — and ideas emerge not from planning, but from the living act of gathering, listening, connecting, and distilling.

## The Method

We have been imagening and building a tool. It is, at one level, quite simple: a website and a system where citizens can speak their thoughts, and where volunteers can collaborate with each other and with artificial intelligence to research, verify, and organize civic information. The rules are drawn from established creative practice:

1. No criticism — every idea is valid
2. Build on ideas — "Yes, and..." not "No, but..."
3. Quantity over quality — get everything out first
4. Wild ideas welcome — refine later
5. Stay on topic

These rules, to a Christian Scientist, are not unfamiliar. They describe what happens in prayer when we stop arguing with the evidence before us and start listening for what is true. "No criticism" is not mere politeness; it is the refusal to give error the first word. "Wild ideas welcome" is the willingness to entertain what seems impossible before deciding it isn't. "Yes, and..." is the compound interest of spiritual sense — each insight building on the last until something no one expected emerges, whole and clear.

The ethics that govern the work are equally plain. They rest on the Golden Rule — "In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you" — which appears across ten major world religions representing 5.9 billion people. This is not a sectarian ethic. It is the broadest common ground humanity has found. And from it comes a single test for every piece of civic information we build:

*Does this benefit all, or just some?*

Research for Maria as carefully as you would want someone to research for you. Verify for Tom as thoroughly as you would want verified for your grandfather. Make it clear for Jamal the way you would want it clear if you were twenty-two and navigating government for the first time.

This is the Golden Rule made concrete. Not abstract compassion but operational love — love with a dollar amount, a phone number, and a next step.

## The Demonstration

Let me describe what it looks like when the rays converge.

A volunteer sits down with the AI guide and begins researching benefits programs for Connecticut. The first input is rough — a note, perhaps dictated into a phone while walking: "Care4Kids — childcare subsidy, CT, look up eligibility." That is a ray. The AI reflects it back, surfaces context: "Care4Kids serves families earning under $60,000/year. The application line is 1-800-842-8277. Here's the .gov source." The volunteer reacts: "Good. What about energy assistance?" Another ray. "EnergizeCT offers weatherization — saves approximately $600/year. Here's the official link." The volunteer connects: "So Maria would get childcare plus energy help. What's the total?" "$9,600 per year in combined benefits."

Five exchanges. One focused idea — not from years of committee work, but from the act of gathering rays into focus. Light: instantaneous.

But here is where the demonstration deepens. Because this is not one volunteer working alone. It is many volunteers across many states, each contributing research, each building on what others have found. And here the second pillar comes into view.

Mrs. Eddy writes in *The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany*:

> "A great sanity, a mighty something buried in the depths of the unseen, has wrought a resurrection among you, and has leaped into living love. What is this something, this phoenix fire, this pillar by day, kindling, guiding, and guarding your way? It is unity, the bond of perfectness, the thousandfold expansion that will engirdle the world, — unity, which unfolds the thought most within us into the greater and better, the sum of all reality and good." (164:18)

"Leaped into living love." This is the phrase I keep returning to. Living love is not sentiment. It is not a feeling about Maria; it is the $9,600 she receives. It is not sympathy for Tom; it is the property tax relief application, translated from legal jargon into plain English, with the phone number right there. It is not admiration for Jamal's ambition; it is the $20,000 down payment program he didn't know existed, found and verified and made clear.

Living love has an address. Living love has a dollar amount. Living love has a phone number.

And living love scales. One volunteer builds one state page. Ten volunteers build ten. The same tool, the same rules, the same ethics, the same AI — at every scale. "The thousandfold expansion that will engirdle the world." Not hypothetically. The technology is the same whether three people are brainstorming at a kitchen table or fifty volunteers across ten states are coordinating research. The only thing that changes is the number of rays converging into focus.

## The Watchfulness

The *Christian Science Sentinel* carries the motto: "What I say unto you I say unto all, Watch" (Mark 13:37). The *Sentinel* was established "to hold guard over Truth, Life, and Love." In this work, the watching takes practical form.

The brainstorming rules *stand guard*. "No criticism" guards the fragile, half-formed thought — the ray that hasn't been focused yet — from being scattered before it can converge with others. Every time a volunteer says "Yes, and..." instead of "No, but...", the sentinel function is active. The AI watches too — not to control, but to notice when a dominant voice drowns out a quiet one, when criticism creeps in disguised as "being realistic," when the conversation drifts from gathering to judging too soon.

And the ethics stand guard at the output. "Does this benefit all, or just some?" That test is sentinel duty. It guards against the subtle temptation to editorialize, to inject opinion, to serve a faction instead of the whole community. Maria, Tom, and Jamal are the sentinels — their real needs standing guard against the abstraction that makes it easy to serve "users" instead of people.

The *Christian Science Journal* carries the motto: "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds" (II Corinthians 10:4). Where the *Sentinel* guards, the *Journal* advances. And the strong holds are real to human sense.

"Government is too complicated for regular people to understand." That is a strong hold. It falls when a volunteer translates "eligible applicants at or below 185% of the federal poverty level for a family unit of corresponding size" into "families earning under $60,000 a year" — and Maria applies.

"I have to figure this out alone." That is a strong hold. It falls when fifteen volunteers across a state build on each other's research, each contribution making the next one clearer, until the page that emerges was in no single person's head.

"We should help people." That is a strong hold — of vagueness. It falls when the abstract intention becomes Maria's $9,600, Tom's $4,200, Jamal's $20,000. Names, dollar amounts, phone numbers. Living love pulled down from generality into the specific.

The weapons are "not carnal." They are not political power, institutional authority, or venture capital. They are ideas, gathered into focus, expanded through unity. Brainstorming rules. Ethics grounded in the Golden Rule. A phone in someone's hand. A volunteer's willingness to research carefully because they built for Maria the way they would want someone to build for them.

## First the Blade

The *Christian Science Monitor* carries the motto: "First the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear" (Mark 4:28), and the mission "to injure no man, but to bless all mankind."

This is the growth pattern we are witnessing. The blade: a single volunteer, a single state, a rough first draft of civic information gathered and organized. The ear: multiple volunteers, multiple states, the tool refined, the patterns proven. The full grain: every state, every town, every citizen able to find in plain language what their government offers and how to access it — civic infrastructure as complete and trustworthy as a public library.

"To injure no man, but to bless all mankind." This is the ultimate test. The information is non-partisan — it describes, it does not editorialize. It serves all residents, not those of one persuasion. It does not weaponize data or manipulate opinion. It does not serve an ideology. It serves Maria, Tom, and Jamal — and the millions they represent — regardless of how they vote, what they believe, or where they come from.

## What Is Being Demonstrated

I want to be clear about what I believe is happening here, because I think it matters to this audience.

The principles are not new. Focused ideas bringing light. Unity unfolding thought into living good. Watching over truth. Pulling down strong holds. First the blade, then the ear. These are the principles many of us have studied, prayed with, and relied upon for years.

What is new is the demonstration.

It is one thing to read that "the rays of infinite Truth, when gathered into the focus of ideas, bring light instantaneously." It is another thing to watch a volunteer dictate a rough thought into a phone, watch the AI reflect it back with context and connections, watch the idea sharpen through iteration, and watch the focused result become a page that saves a family $9,600 a year.

It is one thing to read that unity "unfolds the thought most within us into the greater and better, the sum of all reality and good." It is another thing to watch fifty volunteers across ten states, none of whom have met, each contributing the thought most within them — a piece of research, a clearer way to phrase eligibility, a connection no one else noticed — and watch the combined result serve millions of people in ways none of them could have achieved alone.

It is one thing to understand the Golden Rule. It is another thing to build a system where the Golden Rule is not aspirational but operational — embedded in rules that protect every contribution, ethics that test every output, and technology that makes the whole thing accessible to anyone with a phone.

This is not theory applied to practice. This is Truth being demonstrated in practice — proved, as we say in Christian Science, not adopted.

The blade is visible. The ear is forming. The full grain will feed.
