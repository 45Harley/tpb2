**Page:** https://4tpb.org/
**Estimated runtime:** ~8-10 minutes
**Recording tool:** PowerPoint (Insert → Screen Recording + Record Narration) or OBS Studio

---

## Scene 1: Navigation Bar (top of screen)
**Action:** Mouse over the nav bar slowly, left to right

> "The navigation bar stays at the top of every page. On the left you see the TPB logo — clicking it always takes you home. Next to it: 'Democracy that works.'
>
> On the right is your status line — your user ID, email, town, and your civic points badge in gold. If you haven't added an email or town yet, you'll see blue links inviting you to do so."

---

## Scene 2: Nav Links (Row 2)
**Action:** Hover over each nav link, open each dropdown

> "Row two has your main navigation. **Help** opens a dropdown with Getting Started and Modal Icons. **Me** goes to your profile. **My Town** and **My State** jump to your local pages.
>
> **USA Talk** is our deliberation space. **My Government** drops down to Our Aspirations, My Reps, and the Constitution. **Action** has Election 2026, Amendment 28, polls, and more. **My Power** and **Our Story** explain what TPB is. **Volunteer** is where you help build it."

---

## Scene 3: Election 2026 Badge (left side)
**Action:** Point to the rotating badge

> "This red badge on the left rotates between 'No Kings,' 'No Mobs,' and 'Act Now.' It links to the campaign page. It's a reminder — this platform exists because democracy needs active citizens."

---

## Scene 4: Hero Section
**Action:** Scroll down slowly past the hero

> "The hero section fills your screen. 'A More Perfect Union' — with 'Perfect' highlighted in gold. Below it: 'You are the Fourth Branch.' This is the core idea — citizens are not spectators, they're a branch of government.
>
> At the bottom, a pulsing arrow says 'Scroll to explore.' Click it or scroll down."

---

## Scene 5: Structure of Power (Pyramid)
**Action:** Scroll to the pyramid, pause on each level

> "Here's the Structure of Power. At the top: **You — The Fourth Branch**. Below that, three levels of government — Town, State, and Nation — each with their Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches.
>
> 'No kings. Only citizens.' The Fourth Branch isn't built yet. You're building it."

---

## Scene 6: The Interactive Map
**Action:** Hover over several states

> "This is the heart of the homepage — an interactive map of the United States. Hover over any state and after a second, an info card pops up. Active states show in blue — those have users already. Dark states are coming soon."

---

## Scene 7: State Info Modal
**Action:** Click on Connecticut (or any active state)

> "Click a state and you get its info card — population, capital, largest city, governor with party color, and a voter registration bar showing Democrat, Republican, and Independent percentages.
>
> You'll see links to the state legislature and governor's website. Two buttons: **'This is My State'** to claim it, or **'View State'** to explore its page."

---

## Scene 8: Google Maps — Claiming Your State
**Action:** Click "This is My State"

> "Click 'This is My State' and the map transforms into Google Maps, zoomed to your state. A sidebar appears on the left."

---

## Scene 9: Town Selection
**Action:** Type a town name in the autocomplete

> "Start typing your town name. A dropdown shows up to 15 matches. Click your town and the map zooms in."

---

## Scene 10: Dropping a Pin
**Action:** Click on the map to drop a pin

> "Click anywhere on the map to drop a pin. A place card appears showing your address, town, ZIP, and county. Below it, your districts — US Congress, State Senate, and State House."

---

## Scene 11: Create Account
**Action:** Point to the "Create Account" button

> "Once your pin is placed, the 'Create Account' button appears. Click it and you're taken to the join page with your location already filled in. Street View is also available if you want to see your neighborhood."

---

## Scene 12: Returning Users
**Action:** Show logged-in view

> "If you're already a member and click your state, you'll see a 'Welcome back' card instead — showing your location, civic points, and identity level. A link takes you straight to your profile."

---

## Scene 13: Civic Points
**Action:** Perform an action, show the gold badge pulse

> "Every action earns civic points — visiting the page, clicking a state, looking up your location. Watch the gold badge in the nav — it pulses when you earn points. This is how TPB tracks engagement, not surveillance."

---

## Scene 14: Footer
**Action:** Scroll to bottom

> "The footer has four columns. **The People's Branch** with our contact email. **Platform** links — Home, Our Story, Constitution, Help. **Get Involved** — Join, Volunteer, Profile, Your Reps. And **Legal** — hover over Privacy or Terms to see our promises in plain English.
>
> 'We collect only what's needed. Nothing is sold. Ever.'"

---

## Scene 15: Closing
**Action:** Scroll back to top

> "That's the TPB homepage. Every element exists for one reason — to connect you to your government and your community. Start by finding your state. The rest follows."

## Recording Tips

1. **PowerPoint method:** Create one slide per scene with the script as speaker notes. Use Insert → Screen Recording on each slide, then Record Narration over all slides. Export as MP4.
2. **OBS Studio method:** Record full screen with mic. Use this script as your teleprompter.
3. **Move your mouse slowly** — training videos work best at half your normal speed.
4. **Pause 2-3 seconds** between scenes for breathing room in editing.
