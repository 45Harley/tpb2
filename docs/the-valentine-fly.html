  <!-- Story -->
  <div style="font-size:17px;line-height:1.8;color:#ddc8c8;">

    <p>It had been a brutal winter. The kind where January never lets up, where the snow piles two feet high and you&rsquo;re always plowing, always digging out. Aero, teens, twenties &mdash; that was the daily forecast. My name&rsquo;s Buck. My wife Tizzylish and I live in Putnam, right next door to our son Bunny.</p>

    <p>Then came a warmish February day. Twenty-ish. Practically balmy. &#10084;</p>

    <p>Bunny went outdoors and stopped cold. There, sitting right on top of a snowbank, was a fly. Dead, it seemed &mdash; frozen on the spot, like that guy stepping out of the helicopter in <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em>. Just sitting there on two feet of snow like he&rsquo;d landed and that was that.</p>

    <p>Bunny came over and told us about it. Of course, everyone had a theory. How does a fly end up on top of a snow drift? Where did he come from? What was he <em>thinking?</em></p>

    <p style="text-align:center;color:#b33050;font-size:14px;">&#10084; &#10084; &#10084;</p>

    <p>The next day, Bun and Tiz were coming back from a run to the stores. Bunny spotted the fly again &mdash; still sitting on the drift, same spot. He gave it a poke.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;font-style:italic;color:#e84363;">Wait.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:22px;font-weight:bold;color:#e84363;">The fly moved. &#10084;</p>

    <p>Bun whipped out his iPhone and snapped a picture. <em>&ldquo;Tiz! The fly &mdash; it&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo;</em></p>

    <p>Tiz grabbed the bird seed scoop from the garage and gently scooped up the fly, snow and all. Now, make no mistake &mdash; if that fly had been buzzing around inside her kitchen, Tizzylish would have squashed him flat without a second thought. But something about <strong style="color:#e84363;">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo;</strong> sparked something inside her. ❤️ A frozen fly, surviving the impossible &mdash; she couldn&rsquo;t just leave him there.</p>

    <p>The garage was well insulated, and on this February day the temperature had climbed to a blistering thirty-seven degrees. Tiz set the scoop down inside. The fly stirred, crawling slowly across the little mound of snow, as if he knew &mdash; somehow <em>knew</em> &mdash; he was being saved by this caring woman. He inched his way off the snow and onto a potted plant sitting on the shelf.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;color:#b33050;font-size:14px;">&#10084; &#10084; &#10084;</p>

    <p>Tiz left him there and came into the kitchen, buzzing with excitement herself. She told me the whole story. I couldn&rsquo;t get past the science of it.</p>

    <p><em>&ldquo;How did that fly survive out there? The weatherman said a <strong style="color:#e84363;">human</strong> would freeze to death in twenty minutes!&rdquo;</em></p>

    <p>Flies don&rsquo;t even have blood &mdash; they&rsquo;ve got some kind of juice running through them. But still. <strong><em>How?</em></strong></p>

    <p>Tiz looked at me. <em>&ldquo;We should name him.&rdquo;</em></p>

    <p>I didn&rsquo;t hesitate.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:28px;font-weight:bold;color:#e84363;">&#10084; &ldquo;McFly.&rdquo; &#10084;</p>

    <p>That&rsquo;s it. <strong style="color:#e84363;">McFly.</strong></p>

    <p>He&rsquo;ll greet us next time we go into the garage. <em>&ldquo;Hello, McFly.&rdquo;</em> ❤️</p>

    <p>Maybe we can train him. Maybe he can keep all those <em>other</em> flies away next summer.</p>
