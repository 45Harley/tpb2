# State Builder Volunteer Orientation

**Welcome to the State Builder program.**

You're about to build civic infrastructure that will help thousands of people access government benefits, understand their representatives, and engage with democracy. This isn't just a coding task — it's public service.

**Before you start the technical AI Guide, read this orientation.** It explains why this work matters, who you're building for, and the ethical standards that guide our work.

**Reading time:** 30-35 minutes
**Required:** Yes, before starting your first state build

## Part 0: The Golden Rule — Our Ethical Foundation

### Universal Wisdom, 5.9 Billion People

Before we talk about *what* you'll build or *how* to build it, let's talk about *why* — the ethical foundation that guides everything at TPB.

**The Golden Rule appears across 10 major world religions:**

**Christianity:** "In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you."

**Buddhism:** "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful."

**Confucianism:** "Do not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself."

**Islam:** "Not one of you truly believes until you wish for others what you wish for yourself."

**Hinduism:** "This is the sum of duty: do not do to others what would cause pain if done to you."

**...and 5 more traditions** ([see full list →](https://tpb2.sandgems.net/goldenrule.html))

**5.9 billion people across cultures, languages, and histories recognize this principle:**

Treat others with the same respect, dignity, and care you desire for yourself.

### The Golden Rule in State Building

**Abstract version:** "Practice the Golden Rule while volunteering."
- Your reaction: "Okay, sure, I guess..."

**Concrete version:** "Build the page YOU would want if you were struggling to find childcare help."
- Your reaction: "Right. I need to make this accurate because real people are counting on it."

**In the next section, you'll meet Maria, Tom, and Jamal** — real personas representing real people who will use what you build.

**Building for them IS practicing the Golden Rule:**
- Research benefits for Maria as carefully as you'd want someone to research for you
- Verify property tax info for Tom as thoroughly as you'd want verified for your grandfather
- Make homebuyer programs clear for Jamal the way you'd want them clear if you were 22

**The personas demonstrate selfless service to benefit all.**

---

### TPB's Philosophy: Grassroots & Trust

From our manifesto ([read full version](https://tpb2.sandgems.net/story.php)):

> **"I am grassroots. We are The People."**
>
> "We can always do better. Together we can build a more perfect Union."
>
> "Let's trust each other, or begin to."
>
> "We are family. We need The People. We need You to help."
>
> "Recognizing each other's ideas as the real gold of economy, as the steel feet of progress, as the real angels of this nation and the World."
>
> **"Those thoughts born in true selfless desire to benefit all — The Universal 'Golden Rule.'"**

**What this means for you:**
- You're not an employee → You're a citizen building with fellow citizens
- This isn't a company → It's a grassroots movement
- We're not "users" → We're family, "We the People"
- Your work serves all, not just some (non-partisan, accurate, accessible)

**You don't need to read it now** — but it's there when you need ethical clarity on a tough decision.

---

**Now let's meet who you're building for.** ⬇️

---

## Part 1: Welcome & Mission

### Why The People's Branch Exists

The U.S. Constitution opens with three words: **"We the People."**

Not "We the Politicians." Not "We the Experts." Not "We the Donors."

**We the People** are supposed to be the source of government power. But somewhere along the way, "We the People" became spectators — watching government happen TO us instead of BY us.

**The People's Branch (TPB) exists to change that.**

We're building the infrastructure for the **Fourth Branch of government** — the People themselves. A place where:
- **You can find your representatives** (all of them, easily)
- **You can access benefits you qualify for** (housing, energy, education, healthcare)
- **You can understand your government** (budgets, officials, how things work)
- **You can make your voice heard** (thoughts, ideas, civic engagement)

### Why State Pages Matter

**The problem:**
- Government websites are fragmented, confusing, and hard to navigate
- Benefits programs exist, but people don't know about them
- Citizens don't know who represents them or how to contact officials
- Civic information is scattered across dozens of websites

**Your solution:**
You're building a **one-stop civic hub** for an entire state. One page where residents can:
1. Find every benefit they qualify for
2. See all their representatives (federal and state)
3. Understand how their government works
4. Access state agencies and resources
5. Learn about their state's budget, economy, elections
6. Connect with their local town
7. Share their ideas with their community

**Impact:**
- A single mother finds $9,600/year in childcare and energy assistance
- A senior on fixed income discovers property tax relief worth $3,000/year
- A first-time homebuyer accesses $20,000 down payment help
- A new voter learns how to register and where their polling place is
- A resident contacts their state legislator about a local issue

**Your work = their access.**

---

## Part 2: Who You're Building For

State pages aren't built for politicians, journalists, or activists. They're built for **everyday residents** trying to navigate government and access help.

### Meet Your Users

#### Maria, 34 — Hartford, Connecticut
**Situation:**
- Single mother, two kids (ages 3 and 7)
- Works retail, $32,000/year
- Rents apartment, struggles with childcare costs
- Pays $180/month electric bill (old building, poor insulation)

**What she needs:**
- Affordable childcare so she can work full-time
- Help with energy bills
- Health insurance for her kids
- Information about schools

**How your page helps:**
✅ **Childcare subsidy:** Finds CT Care4Kids program → $400/month assistance
✅ **Energy assistance:** Finds EnergizeCT weatherization → saves $600/year
✅ **Health insurance:** Finds HUSKY (CT Medicaid) eligibility info
✅ **Schools:** Links to state education department resources

**Your impact on Maria:** $9,600/year in benefits + access to health coverage

**What happens if you get it wrong:**
- Broken link to Care4Kids? → She doesn't apply, continues struggling
- Outdated eligibility info? → She thinks she doesn't qualify, gives up
- Missing phone number? → She can't get help navigating application

---

#### Tom, 67 — Bridgeport, Connecticut
**Situation:**
- Retired teacher, lives on pension + Social Security ($42,000/year)
- Owns home (paid off), but property taxes keep rising ($4,800/year)
- Takes 5 prescription medications ($320/month)
- Wife has Alzheimer's, needs care

**What he needs:**
- Property tax relief (fixed income, taxes rising)
- Prescription drug assistance
- Senior programs and resources
- Caregiver support

**How your page helps:**
✅ **Property tax freeze:** Finds CT Senior Property Tax Relief → saves $2,400/year
✅ **Prescription help:** Finds ConnPACE (CT pharmaceutical assistance) → saves $150/month
✅ **Senior programs:** Links to Area Agency on Aging resources
✅ **Caregiver support:** Finds CT Statewide Respite Care program

**Your impact on Tom:** $4,200/year savings + critical caregiver support

**What happens if you get it wrong:**
- Incorrect income limits? → He thinks he doesn't qualify, loses thousands
- Missing phone number for ConnPACE? → Can't navigate enrollment, pays full price
- Outdated program info? → Applies for cancelled program, wastes time

---

#### Jamal, 22 — New Haven, Connecticut
**Situation:**
- Recent college grad, first job ($48,000/year)
- Lives with roommates, wants to buy a house someday
- Paying off student loans ($18,000 remaining)
- Never voted, not sure how to register

**What he needs:**
- First-time homebuyer programs
- Student loan information
- Voter registration
- Understanding how state government works

**How your page helps:**
✅ **Down payment assistance:** Finds CHFA program → $20,000 to $50,000 help
✅ **Voter registration:** Clear instructions + link to register online
✅ **State legislators:** Can see his reps, learn how to contact them
✅ **Civic engagement:** Can share ideas about improving his community

**Your impact on Jamal:** Becomes homeowner 5 years sooner + engaged citizen

**What happens if you get it wrong:**
- Confusing eligibility? → Assumes he doesn't qualify, rents for 10+ years
- Broken voter registration link? → Doesn't register, doesn't vote
- Missing legislator contact info? → Can't engage with representatives

---

### The Pattern You'll See

**Every user has the same core needs:**
1. **Access** — Find programs and benefits they qualify for
2. **Clarity** — Understand eligibility without legal jargon
3. **Connection** — Contact government (officials, agencies)
4. **Trust** — Verify information is current and accurate
5. **Action** — Know next steps (apply here, call this number, register to vote)

**Your job:** Make all five happen through accurate, clear, accessible information.

---

## Part 3: Ethics & Quality Standards

Building state pages requires ethical commitments. You're creating public infrastructure — like building a bridge. If the bridge is faulty, people get hurt.

### Core Ethical Commitments

#### 1. **Accuracy Over Speed**

**Standard:** Only publish verified information from authoritative sources.

**In practice:**
- ✅ Use .gov websites as primary sources (state.gov, legislature.gov, agency.gov)
- ✅ Cross-reference data when possible (if two .gov sites conflict, investigate)
- ✅ Document every source (so others can verify and update)
- ✅ Mark uncertainty clearly ("Could not verify, needs review")

**Wrong:**
❌ "I found it on Wikipedia, good enough"
❌ "This 2020 data is probably still accurate"
❌ "I can't find it, so I'll just skip this section"

**Right:**
✅ "Official state website says $15,000 max, I'll use that"
✅ "2020 data is outdated, let me find 2025/2026 budget"
✅ "Can't verify this number, I'll note it in BUILD-LOG for PM review"

**Why it matters:**
Maria applies for a program you listed. If the dollar amount is wrong, she gets rejected. If the link is broken, she can't apply. If eligibility is unclear, she gives up.

**Your accuracy = their access.**

---

#### 2. **Non-Partisanship**

**Standard:** Describe government, don't editiorialize or inject political bias.

**In practice:**
- ✅ State facts: "Governor Ned Lamont (Democrat), elected 2018"
- ✅ Describe programs neutrally: "Provides up to $20,000 down payment assistance"
- ✅ Present budget objectively: "$51 billion total, 40% education, 30% health"

**Wrong:**
❌ "Governor Lamont's wasteful spending on..."
❌ "Excellent program that helps hardworking families..."
❌ "Democrats control 98 seats (unfortunately)"

**Right:**
✅ "Governor Ned Lamont, Democrat, first term"
✅ "Down payment assistance program, up to $20,000"
✅ "Democrats: 98 seats, Republicans: 53 seats"

**Why it matters:**
TPB serves ALL residents — conservative, liberal, independent, apolitical. The moment we inject bias, we lose trust. Residents need facts to make their own decisions.

**Your neutrality = their trust.**

---

#### 3. **Accessibility**

**Standard:** Write for regular people, not bureaucrats or lawyers.

**In practice:**
- ✅ Clear language (not jargon): "childcare help" not "dependent care subsidy appropriation"
- ✅ Plain eligibility: "Income under $60,000/year" not "185% FPL for family of 4"
- ✅ Action-oriented: "Call 1-800-XXX-XXXX to apply" not "Applications may be submitted via telephonic inquiry"
- ✅ Mobile-friendly: Test on phone, not just desktop

**Wrong:**
❌ "Pursuant to CGS §17b-749, eligible applicants at or below 185% of the federal poverty level may apply for Care4Kids assistance subject to appropriation availability"

**Right:**
✅ "**Who qualifies:** Families earning under $60,000/year. **How to apply:** Call 1-800-842-8277 or visit care4kids.com"

**Why it matters:**
If Tom can't understand the eligibility requirements, he won't apply. If Maria has to decipher legal language, she'll give up. Government is already confusing enough — your job is to translate it into plain English.

**Your clarity = their understanding.**

---

#### 4. **Transparency**

**Standard:** Document sources, show your work, make updates easy.

**In practice:**
- ✅ Cite sources in comments: `<!-- Source: portal.ct.gov/opm/budget, accessed 2025-02-10 -->`
- ✅ Include URLs so future volunteers can update
- ✅ Note uncertainties: "Could not verify 2026 session dates, using 2025 pattern"
- ✅ Document in BUILD-LOG: what you found, what you couldn't find, what needs review

**Why it matters:**
Budgets change. Officials get elected. Programs get updated. Dollar amounts change. The page needs to be updated next year. If you don't document sources, future volunteers start from scratch.

**Your documentation = future accuracy.**

---

## Part 4: Quality = Trust = Impact

### Why Details Matter

**You might think:** "Does it really matter if I use the 2024 budget instead of 2026?"

**Yes. Here's why:**

**Scenario 1: Outdated Benefit Amount**
- **You write:** "$15,000 max down payment assistance" (2022 data)
- **Current program:** $20,000 max (2025)
- **What happens:** Jamal sees $15k, thinks "not enough," doesn't apply
- **Reality:** He qualified for $20k, would have bought a house
- **Your mistake = his lost opportunity**

**Scenario 2: Broken Link**
- **You write:** Link to HUSKY health insurance application
- **What happens:** Link goes to old domain, 404 error
- **Reality:** Maria's kid doesn't get health coverage because she couldn't find the application
- **Your broken link = her child without insurance**

**Scenario 3: Wrong Eligibility**
- **You write:** "Income under $50,000/year" (you misread the chart)
- **Current program:** Income under $60,000/year
- **What happens:** Tom earns $55k, thinks he doesn't qualify, doesn't apply
- **Reality:** He qualified, would have saved $2,400/year on property taxes
- **Your error = $2,400 lost**

### The Trust Equation

**Quality builds trust:**
- Accurate data → residents trust the site
- Trust the site → they use it
- They use it → they find programs
- They find programs → their lives improve
- Their lives improve → they tell others
- Others use site → more people helped

**Poor quality breaks trust:**
- One broken link → "This site isn't reliable"
- Outdated info → "This is wrong, I'll ask my neighbor instead"
- Confusing language → "Too complicated, I give up"
- No trust → no use → no impact

**Your quality = the site's reputation = community impact.**

---

## Part 5: Your Role as Civic Infrastructure Builder

### What You're Actually Doing

**You might think:** "I'm filling out a template with data."

**Actually:** You're building public infrastructure.

Think of yourself as:
- **A bridge engineer** — people rely on your work to be solid
- **A librarian** — organizing public knowledge so people can find it
- **A public servant** — serving your community (even though you're a volunteer)
- **A civic architect** — designing democracy infrastructure

### What "Infrastructure" Means

**Physical infrastructure:**
- Roads → so people can travel
- Water systems → so people can drink
- Electric grid → so people have power

**Civic infrastructure:**
- Voter registration → so people can participate
- Representative lookup → so people can contact government
- Benefits directory → so people can access help

**You're building the third one.**

Just like a broken water main hurts a community, broken civic infrastructure hurts democracy.

### Your Civic Duty

You're not getting paid. You're volunteering. Why does that matter?

**Because volunteers built America:**
- Town meetings (colonial volunteers organized democracy)
- Fire departments (Ben Franklin started volunteer firefighting)
- Libraries (Andrew Carnegie funded, communities volunteered)
- Open source software (Linux, Wikipedia, Mozilla — volunteers)

**You're in that tradition:** Building public goods for the common welfare.

---

## Part 6: Practical Scenarios

How do you make ethical decisions when building? Here are real scenarios you'll face:

### Scenario 1: Source Conflict

**Situation:**
You're researching Connecticut's state budget deficit/surplus.
- Wikipedia says: "$500 million surplus"
- State Comptroller website says: "$234 million surplus"
- Hartford Courant article says: "$600 million surplus"

**What do you do?**

❌ **Wrong:** Use Wikipedia (easiest to read)
❌ **Wrong:** Average the three ($445 million)
❌ **Wrong:** Use the newspaper (most recent)

✅ **Right:** Use State Comptroller website (official source), cite URL, note the discrepancy in BUILD-LOG

**Why:** Official .gov sources are authoritative. Media can round or use different fiscal years. Wikipedia can be outdated.

---

### Scenario 2: Can't Find Data

**Situation:**
You're trying to find the Chief Justice of Connecticut's Supreme Court. You search for 30 minutes, can't find a clear answer.

**What do you do?**

❌ **Wrong:** Skip it and move on
❌ **Wrong:** Guess based on news articles
❌ **Wrong:** Leave it blank with no explanation

✅ **Right:** Note in BUILD-LOG: "Could not verify Chief Justice name from official source (checked ct.gov/jud, Wikipedia, Ballotpedia). Needs PM review or future volunteer."

**Why:** Future volunteers can pick up where you left off. PM can escalate if needed. Transparency about gaps is better than wrong data.

---

### Scenario 3: Outdated but "Good Enough"

**Situation:**
You find a 2023 page about Connecticut's childcare subsidy program. Dollar amounts are there, but you're not sure if they changed for 2025.

**What do you do?**

❌ **Wrong:** Use 2023 data (probably close enough)
❌ **Wrong:** Make up 2025 data based on inflation

✅ **Right:** Search for current 2025/2026 program page. If you can't find it, call the agency or note in BUILD-LOG "Used 2023 data, could not verify 2025 amounts"

**Why:** Maria might not qualify for the 2023 amount but would qualify for 2025. Tom might qualify for more than 2023 data shows. Current = accurate.

---

### Scenario 4: Partisan Language Creeping In

**Situation:**
You're describing Connecticut's budget. You personally think the spending priorities are wrong. You're tempted to write:

"Connecticut spends too much on administration and not enough on roads."

**What do you do?**

❌ **Wrong:** Include your opinion (seems harmless)
❌ **Wrong:** Rephrase it as "some critics say..." (still editorializing)

✅ **Right:** State facts only: "Connecticut budget: 40% education, 25% healthcare, 15% transportation, 10% administration, 10% other. [Source]"

**Why:** Residents can form their own opinions from facts. The moment you inject opinion, you've broken trust with half your audience.

---

### Scenario 5: Accessibility Challenge

**Situation:**
The official state website describes a program like this:

"Eligible applicants at or below 185% of the federal poverty level for a family unit of corresponding size may submit applications pursuant to program guidelines subject to available appropriations."

**What do you do?**

❌ **Wrong:** Copy it verbatim (it's official language!)
❌ **Wrong:** Link to it and say "see official site" (passing the buck)

✅ **Right:** Translate it: "**Who qualifies:** Families earning under $60,000/year (exact limit depends on family size). [Check eligibility calculator →]"

**Why:** Official language protects the agency legally. Your job is to help residents understand and access. Link to official source, but translate for clarity.

---

## Part 7: Your Commitment

Before you start building, understand what you're committing to:

### Quality Pledge

**I commit to:**
- ✅ Using official .gov sources as primary references
- ✅ Verifying data is current (2025/2026, not outdated)
- ✅ Testing every link I include (if it 404s, I don't publish it)
- ✅ Writing in clear, accessible language
- ✅ Remaining non-partisan and neutral
- ✅ Documenting sources so future volunteers can update
- ✅ Noting gaps or uncertainties honestly
- ✅ Prioritizing user needs (Maria, Tom, Jamal) over convenience

**I understand that:**
- ✅ My work will be reviewed (TEST task) before going live
- ✅ Rejection isn't failure — it's quality control
- ✅ I can ask for help if stuck (don't guess or fabricate)
- ✅ Accuracy matters more than speed
- ✅ Real people will rely on what I build

### What Success Looks Like

**Your build is successful when:**
- ✅ Maria finds childcare assistance worth $400/month
- ✅ Tom discovers property tax relief saving $2,400/year
- ✅ Jamal learns about $20,000 down payment help
- ✅ A resident contacts their state legislator for the first time
- ✅ A family accesses health insurance they didn't know existed
- ✅ A senior finds prescription drug assistance
- ✅ A voter registers and participates in democracy

**Success = impact on real lives.**

## Part 8: Before You Start the AI Guide

You've finished the orientation. Before you start the technical AI Guide, reflect on these questions:

### Self-Check Questions

**1. Do I understand WHY I'm building this?**
- Not just "to complete a task"
- To help residents access benefits, understand government, engage civically

**2. Do I know WHO I'm building for?**
- Maria (childcare, energy help)
- Tom (senior programs, property tax relief)
- Jamal (homebuyer programs, voter registration)
- Real people with real needs

**3. Do I commit to QUALITY standards?**
- Accuracy over speed
- Official sources (.gov)
- Current data (2025/2026)
- Clear language
- Non-partisan
- Documented sources

**4. Am I ready to SERVE my community?**
- This is public service (even though unpaid)
- Real people rely on accuracy
- Trust is earned through quality
- Civic infrastructure matters

**If you answered YES to all four → you're ready to start the AI Guide.**

**If you're unsure on any → re-read that section of this orientation.**

---

## Next Steps

**You're ready to build. Here's what happens next:**

1. **Start the AI Guide**
   - Download: `STATE-BUILDER-AI-GUIDE.md`
   - Upload to Claude AI (claude.ai)
   - Work through 7 phases (4-6 hours)

2. **Remember Your Purpose**
   - When research gets tedious (it will), remember Maria
   - When you're tempted to skip verification (don't), remember Tom
   - When you want to use outdated data (no), remember Jamal

3. **Ask for Help**
   - Stuck on data? Note in BUILD-LOG
   - Unclear instructions? Ask PM or Slack
   - Technical issues? Post in volunteer forum
   - Don't guess. Don't fabricate. Ask.

4. **Quality Check Before Submission**
   - Run through: `state-build-checklist.md`
   - Test every link (click them all)
   - Verify data is current (not 2020 or 2022)
   - Read it on mobile (does it work?)
   - Ask: "Would this help Maria find benefits?"

5. **Submit with Pride**
   - You built civic infrastructure
   - You served your community
   - You helped real people access government
   - You strengthened democracy
