# The People's Branch — Ethical Foundation

**A guide to the philosophy, values, and principles that guide TPB volunteers**

This document explains the deeper "why" behind The People's Branch. If you're building state pages, contributing code, or helping in any way, understanding this foundation helps you make better decisions aligned with our mission.

**Reading time:** 20-30 minutes
**Recommended:** Read once before your first contribution, return when you need ethical clarity

## Part 1: The Golden Rule — Universal Ethics

### The Foundation of Human Cooperation

Across 10 major world religions and philosophies, representing **5.9 billion people**, one ethical principle appears again and again:

**Treat others as you would want to be treated.**

This isn't a TPB invention. It's not American, or Western, or modern. It's **universal human wisdom** that transcends culture, language, and time.

### Why This Matters for TPB

**5.9 billion people across cultures, languages, and histories agree:**

The ethical life is rooted in **reciprocal compassion** — treating others with the same respect, dignity, and care you desire for yourself.

**This is TPB's ethical foundation.**

Not because it's trendy. Not because it's American. But because it's **human**.

When you build for The People's Branch, you're not serving an organization. You're serving **fellow human beings** — and the Golden Rule guides how we serve.

> The Universal **"Golden Rule"** recognized in all cultures
> and by more than 5.9 billion individuals.

---

### What This Means

#### 1. **Grassroots = We Build It Ourselves**

TPB isn't:
- ❌ Funded by billionaires
- ❌ Built by Silicon Valley
- ❌ Controlled by political parties
- ❌ Venture-backed with exit strategy

TPB is:
- ✅ Built by citizens who refuse to do nothing
- ✅ Funded on retirement budgets ($100/month)
- ✅ Powered by AI + determination + wisdom
- ✅ Volunteer-built civic infrastructure

**You're not working for a company. You're building with your neighbors.**

---

#### 2. **"We the People" — Not Users, Not Audience, PEOPLE**

**Language matters:**

**Don't say:** "Users will access the site"
**Say:** "Citizens will find benefits"

**Don't say:** "Target audience"
**Say:** "Fellow Americans" or "Our neighbors"

**Don't say:** "Customers" or "Consumers"
**Say:** "People" or "Residents"

**Why?**

"Users" are abstract. Maria is **real**.
"Audience" is passive. Tom is **active** (finding property tax relief).
"Customers" buy things. Jamal is a **citizen** exercising his right to participate.

**This language shift changes how we build:**
- Build for people, not metrics
- Serve citizens, not "engagement"
- Strengthen democracy, not "user base"

---

#### 3. **"Let's Trust Each Other, or Begin To"**

**Trust is TPB's currency.**

Without trust:
- Maria doesn't use the benefits info (thinks it's a scam)
- Tom doesn't believe the eligibility data (assumes it's wrong)
- Jamal doesn't contact his legislator (thinks no one will listen)
- Citizens don't participate (government feels rigged)

**Trust is earned through:**
- **Accuracy** → We verify every source (.gov only)
- **Transparency** → We cite where data comes from
- **Non-partisanship** → We describe, we don't editorialize
- **Consistency** → Quality every time, not sometimes
- **Honesty** → "We don't know" is better than guessing

**As a volunteer:**
- We trust you to build with care
- You trust us to review fairly (TEST task)
- Citizens trust what we build together
- **"Let's trust each other, or begin to"** — this is how democracy heals

---

#### 4. **"We Are Family"**

Not corporate-speak. Actual principle.

**What this means:**
- When you succeed (great build), we all succeed
- When you struggle (can't find data), we help
- When you make mistakes (everyone does), we learn together
- When you contribute ideas, we listen

**Family doesn't mean:**
- Everyone agrees all the time (we won't)
- No standards (quality still matters)
- No accountability (TEST task exists for a reason)

**Family means:**
- We assume good intent
- We support each other
- We're building something bigger than ourselves
- Your contribution matters, whether you build 1 state or 50

---

#### 5. **Ideas Are the Real Gold**

From the manifesto:

> "Recognizing each other's ideas as the **real gold of economy**,
> as the **steel feet of progress**,
> as the **real angels of this nation.**"

**In practice:**

**Your idea for improving the benefits section?** → Real gold.
**Your suggestion for better mobile layout?** → Steel feet of progress.
**Your thought about how to reach seniors?** → Real angels.

**This means:**
- We listen to volunteers (not just PMs)
- Good ideas come from anywhere (not just "experts")
- Civic thoughts matter (not just code contributions)
- **Thoughts born in selfless desire to benefit all** are valued most

**How to contribute ideas:**
- Post in volunteer Slack/forum
- Add notes in task comments
- Suggest in BUILD-LOG
- Use the "Brainstorm" thought submission system

**Ideas without ego:**
- "Here's what might work better..."  ✅
- "I'm the only one who knows..."  ❌
- "What if we tried..."  ✅
- "Everyone else is wrong..."  ❌

---

## Part 3: Selfless Desire to Benefit All

### The Core Test

When making decisions as a volunteer, ask:

**"Does this benefit ALL, or just some?"**

---

### Examples in State Building:

#### Scenario 1: Partisan Language Temptation

**Situation:** You're describing the state budget. You personally think spending priorities are wrong.

**Selfish approach:** Inject your opinion to influence readers
- "State wastes money on X"
- "Finally, wise spending on Y"
- **Benefits:** Your political perspective
- **Harms:** Half the citizens lose trust, stop using the site

**Selfless approach:** State facts neutrally
- "40% education, 25% healthcare, 15% transportation..."
- Let citizens form their own opinions
- **Benefits:** ALL citizens (both parties) trust the data
- **Harms:** None (except your ego doesn't get expressed)

**The test:** Does neutral language benefit all? **Yes.**
Does partisan language benefit all? **No** (only those who agree).

**Choose selfless.**

---

#### Scenario 2: Accessibility vs. Speed

**Situation:** Official website uses complex legal language. You could copy it verbatim (faster) or translate to plain English (slower).

**Selfish approach:** Copy/paste, move on
- Saves 30 minutes
- **Benefits:** You (finish faster, earn points sooner)
- **Harms:** Tom (can't understand eligibility), doesn't apply, loses $2,400/year

**Selfless approach:** Translate to clear language
- Takes extra 30 minutes
- **Benefits:** Tom and thousands like him (understand, apply, get help)
- **Harms:** You (takes longer)

**The test:** Does accessible language benefit all? **Yes.**
Does legal jargon benefit all? **No** (only lawyers and bureaucrats).

**Choose selfless.**

---

#### Scenario 3: Source Verification

**Situation:** You find program data on Wikipedia (easy) and .gov site (harder to navigate).

**Selfish approach:** Use Wikipedia
- Easier to read
- Faster
- **Benefits:** You (less work)
- **Harms:** Maria (if Wikipedia is outdated, she applies for wrong amount, gets rejected)

**Selfless approach:** Use .gov source
- Harder to navigate
- Takes longer to verify
- **Benefits:** Maria and all residents (accurate data they can trust)
- **Harms:** You (more effort)

**The test:** Do official sources benefit all? **Yes.**
Does convenience benefit all? **No** (only you).

**Choose selfless.**

---

### The Pattern

**Selfless service means:**
- Quality over speed (benefits citizens, costs you time)
- Accuracy over convenience (benefits citizens, costs you effort)
- Clarity over jargon (benefits citizens, costs you translation work)
- Neutrality over opinion (benefits citizens, costs you ego)

**This is the Golden Rule in action:**

Build for Maria as you'd want someone to build for you.
Verify for Tom as you'd want someone to verify for you.
Clarify for Jamal as you'd want someone to clarify for you.

**"Selfless desire to benefit all."**

---

## Part 4: How This Connects to State Building

### The Golden Rule Made Concrete

**Abstract:** "Practice the Golden Rule"
- Response: "Okay, sure, I guess..."

**Concrete:** "Maria is struggling with childcare. Build the page YOU would want if you were her."
- Response: "Right. I need to get this data accurate because she's counting on it."

**The personas (Maria, Tom, Jamal) are the Golden Rule embodied.**

---

### Every Decision Is Ethical

**When you research benefits programs:**
- Golden Rule: Find accurate data as you'd want someone to find it for you
- Grassroots: You're family helping family, not employee serving customer
- Trust: Citizens trust what you verify — earn that trust
- Selfless: Benefit all (verify carefully) vs. benefit self (rush, guess)

**When you write descriptions:**
- Golden Rule: Make it clear the way you'd want it clear for you
- We the People: You're writing for fellow citizens, not "users"
- Trust: Plain language builds trust, jargon destroys it
- Selfless: Benefit all (translate to clear English) vs. benefit self (copy/paste)

**When you cite sources:**
- Golden Rule: Document as thoroughly as you'd want documented for you
- Trust: Future volunteers can update, citizens can verify
- Selfless: Benefit all (future accuracy) vs. benefit self (skip documentation)

**When you encounter partisan material:**
- Golden Rule: Present facts as you'd want them presented to you
- We the People: Serve all citizens, not just those who agree with you
- Trust: Neutrality earns trust from everyone
- Selfless: Benefit all (neutral facts) vs. benefit self (spread your opinion)

---

### You're Not "Completing a Task"

**You might think:** "I'm filling out a state page template."

**Actually:** You're practicing the Golden Rule at scale.

**Maria × 1,000** will find childcare help because you verified it.
**Tom × 1,000** will save on property taxes because you made it clear.
**Jamal × 1,000** will buy homes because you documented down payment programs.

**Multiply your 4-6 hours of careful work:**
- Touches 10,000+ residents over the next year
- Connects thousands to benefits they didn't know existed
- Saves millions of dollars (collectively) for people who need it
- Strengthens democracy by making government accessible

**Golden Rule at scale = civic infrastructure.**

---

## Part 5: The Bigger Picture

### Why TPB Exists

From the manifesto:

> "The People's Branch (TPB) is being conceived.
> Initial delivery is hard, but the promise is worth it.
> We will need The People to shepherd this baby into adulthood."

**The promise:**

Democracy works when "We the People" can:
- **Find benefits** they qualify for (Maria)
- **Understand government** structure and budgets (education)
- **Contact representatives** easily (accountability)
- **Share ideas** and be heard (civic thoughts)
- **Participate** in continuous democratic conversation

**Right now:**
- Government websites are fragmented, confusing
- Benefits programs exist but people don't know about them
- Representatives don't hear from constituents continuously
- Civic participation happens only every 2-4 years (elections)

**TPB changes this:**
- **State pages** = one-stop civic hub (what you're building)
- **Representative lookup** = find and contact officials
- **Civic thoughts** = continuous democratic conversation
- **Transparency** = make government visible

**You're building the Fourth Branch of government** — the People themselves, with infrastructure to actually BE the people.

---

### Your Role in History

**Past civic infrastructure built by grassroots volunteers:**
- Town meetings (colonial volunteers organized democracy)
- Fire departments (Ben Franklin started volunteer firefighting)
- Libraries (Andrew Carnegie funded, communities volunteered)
- Parks and recreation (volunteers built and maintain)
- Open source software (Linux, Wikipedia, Mozilla — volunteers)

**You're in that tradition:**

Not paid developers (can't afford).
Not politicians (we're the people).
Not corporations (grassroots).

**Citizens building public goods for the common welfare.**

TPB is your generation's library. Your decade's town meeting. Your contribution to democracy infrastructure.

**Small acts × many people = functioning democracy.**

You verify childcare data (small act).
1,000 volunteers build 50 states (many people).
10 million Americans find benefits and engage civically (functioning democracy).

**The Golden Rule, practiced at scale, builds nations.**

---

## Part 6: Practical Application

### When You're Unsure, Return to Ethics

**You'll face decisions the AI Guide doesn't cover:**

**Unknown scenario:** "Should I include this program even though eligibility is unclear?"

**Ethical framework:**
1. **Golden Rule:** Would you want someone to include it if you were Maria?
   - If yes (better to know it exists), include with note: "Eligibility unclear, contact agency to verify"
   - If no (would mislead), skip it or note in BUILD-LOG for PM review

2. **Trust:** Does including unclear info build or break trust?
   - With clear disclaimer? Builds trust (honest about limits)
   - Without disclaimer? Breaks trust (seems like we know, but we don't)

3. **Selfless:** Does it benefit all or just make your task easier?
   - Benefits all: Include with disclaimer (residents have the info)
   - Benefits self: Skip it (less work but residents lose access)

**Decision:** Include with clear disclaimer. Document in BUILD-LOG.

---

**Unknown scenario:** "Source A says $15k max, Source B says $20k max. What do I do?"

**Ethical framework:**
1. **Golden Rule:** What would you want someone to do if you were applying?
   - You'd want the RIGHT amount, not the guessed amount

2. **Trust:** Guessing destroys trust when someone gets rejected
   - Must verify which is correct

3. **Selfless:** Which serves all vs. serves your convenience?
   - Verify (serves all, takes effort)
   - Guess (serves self, quick but risky)

**Decision:** Investigate further. Check dates (which is more recent?). Check official status (.gov > news article). If still unclear, note both amounts and flag for PM review.

---

### The Ethics Checklist

Before submitting any build, ask:

**Golden Rule:**
- ✅ Would I trust this page if I were Maria/Tom/Jamal?
- ✅ Is data accurate enough that I'd bet my own money on it?
- ✅ Is language clear enough that my grandmother would understand?

**We the People:**
- ✅ Does this serve all citizens, not just some?
- ✅ Is it non-partisan (facts only, no opinion)?
- ✅ Would both Democrats and Republicans find it useful?

**Trust:**
- ✅ Are all sources cited and verifiable?
- ✅ Can future volunteers update easily (documented)?
- ✅ Are limitations acknowledged honestly ("couldn't verify X")?

**Selfless:**
- ✅ Did I prioritize accuracy over speed?
- ✅ Did I translate jargon even though it took extra time?
- ✅ Did I verify sources even though Wikipedia was easier?
- ✅ Am I proud to put my name on this (BUILD-LOG)?

**If you can answer YES to all → submit with confidence.**
**If any are NO → fix before submitting.**

---

## Part 7: You're Not Alone

### The Community

**From the manifesto:**

> "We are family. We need The People. We need You to help."

**What this means:**

**When you're stuck:**
- Post in volunteer Slack/forum
- Ask in task comments
- Reach out to PM
- **Don't suffer silently** — we're family, we help

**When you make mistakes:**
- TEST task might reject your build
- **This is support, not punishment**
- Learn, fix, resubmit
- Everyone makes mistakes (even experienced builders)

**When you have ideas:**
- Share them (ideas are the real gold)
- They might be used in other state builds
- They might improve the whole system
- **Your voice matters**

**When you feel small:**
- Remember: One person + AI = shipping democracy infrastructure
- Remember: Small acts × many people = functioning democracy
- Remember: You're building what Maria needs, Tom needs, Jamal needs
- **Your work matters**

---

### We're In This Together

**You're not:**
- An employee (you're a citizen)
- A cog in a machine (you're a builder)
- Alone in this (you're family)
- Just completing tasks (you're serving the Golden Rule)

**You are:**
- Part of a grassroots movement
- A civic infrastructure builder
- Practicing the Golden Rule at scale
- Helping shepherd democracy into adulthood

**"We want to sing. Let's do it together in beautiful harmonies."**

Your state build is one voice in that harmony.
