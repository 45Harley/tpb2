# 0media/

Media assets for TPB — images, audio, and video used by `story.php`, `index.php`, and other pages.

**Important:** MP3, MP4, and ZIP files are **gitignored**. They must be deployed to the server separately using `scripts/deploy/media.sh`.

Only `PeoplesBranch.png` (and other images) are tracked in git.

See [docs/media-management.md](../docs/media-management.md) for full details.
